    description: `
If you have been elected to receive a travel reimbursement, we will contact you after the hackathon to send it to you. You will receive a maximum that has been specified in the email, based on current travelling prices and distances. Requirements to receive travel reimbursement are as follows.
- Received an email with travel reimbursement amount.
- Travel reimbursement receipts submitted before the date specified by HackUPC Team.
- Project submitted to Devpost before due date.
- Demo your project in the HackUPC judging rooms.

The processing of travel reimbursements takes some time. Our schedule depends on our sponsors' schedule. We expect to have them sent out in a 1-2 months time period. Remember that you need to post a project before the deadline in order to get the reimbursement!`,
