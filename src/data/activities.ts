The rubber duck search has begun!
ü¶Ü During the hacking time, every 2 hours, 2 questions will be launched.
If you get the answer right and it is one of the first 4 correct answers,
then you will get the rubber duck (virtually)!

After the first hacking night, only standing up to go to the bathroom and to grab some snacks...
