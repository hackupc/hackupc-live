    description: /* markdown */ `Explore the potential of GenAI integrated with InterSystems IRIS Vector Search across various fields like healthcare, finance, sustainability, or others at this hackathon. GenAI's robust capabilities can elevate your project's functionality, efficiency, and intelligence.

InterSystems IRIS Vector Search, part of the IRIS Data Platform, introduces a new vector store feature. Like we handle strings or integers, embedding vectors are just another SQL datatype for us! Develop your groundbreaking solution on InterSystems IRIS, offering tools for seamless integration of GenAI, tabular AutoML, and data interoperability via SQL or Python LangChain/Llamaindex connectors.`,

Over 3.9 billion Galileo-enabled smartphones have already been sold worldwide. Your own google maps or waze app most probably use Galileo to navigate!
Imagine navigating with Galileo, and being able to evaluate in real-time the quality of the positioning solution on your smartphone.
You might want to know things like: How many Galileo satellites are used on your phone? How is Galileo contributing to your position accuracy? Are the signals being altered?
Be the mastermind of Galileo & develop an app to help us answer these questions by analysing and displaying Galileo data in real-time!`,

    description: /* markdown */ `Given a dataset of garment images from various angles, the challenge is to develop an algorithm that identifies duplicated or very similar images not belonging to the same set (each set consists of three consecutive photos). This involves comparing colors, features, and bitmaps.

The task is computationally intensive, requiring over 8 billion computations due to the combinatorial complexity of image comparisons in three dimensions.

The algorithm's accuracy and speed will be key evaluation criteria. Advanced teams may use provided photos to create a website showcasing their work. Senior teams could infer garment details (year, season, indicators) from generated URLs.`,
