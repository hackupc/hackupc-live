    description: /* markdown */ `
4 years ago we launched the version of APIs and Webhooks for Typeform, giving developers the tools
necessary to build apps and automation around data collection.
For HackUPC we are releasing a new tool that will let developers build apps directly inside Typeform UI.
This workshop is an introduction to this new framework. No previous experience needed, first-timers welcome.

    title: 'A Deep Learning solution to improve match-making in InfoJobs',
    description: /* markdown */ `
As the machine learning team of InfoJobs we developed a high-accuracy end-to-end system that
normalizes the "job title" field of job offers and résumée entries posted on our site.
The solution is based on a deep learning model that uses NLP and transfer learning methods.
The obtained solution has been crucial in increasing the matching between applicants and vacancies in our site.
