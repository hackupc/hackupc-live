When you have a **line completed**, go to the infoDesk and claim your reward!
Donâ€™t forget to **carry the mission card to all these events**! The organizer in charge of the activity will stamp it. If there isn't an organizer to stamp your card, you should go to the infoDesk (the same location as baggage) and **show a proof** that you have completed the task.
You can find more information on when the activities are happening in the **[Schedule section](https://live.hackupc.com/schedule)**.
