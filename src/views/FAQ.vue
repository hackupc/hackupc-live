          <h1>Travel reimbursement</h1>
          <div>
            <p class="margin-bottom">If you have been elected to receive a travel reimbursement, we will contact you after the hackathon to send it to you. You will receive a maximum that has been specified on the email, based on current travelling prices and distances. Requirements to receive travel reimbursement are as follows.</p>
            <ul class="margin-bottom">
              <li>Received an email with travel reimbursement amount.</li>
              <li>Travel reimbursement receipts submitted before the date specified by HackUPC Team.</li>
              <li>Project submitted to Devpost before due date.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The processing of travel reimbursements takes some time. Our schedule depends on our sponsors' schedule. We expect to have them sent out in a 1-2 months time period. Remember that you need to post a project before the deadline in order to get the reimbursement!</p>

              We will have a judging expo on Sunday from 10:15 am - 13:15 am. We'll assign you a classroom to present your project (one for HackUPC + as many challenges as you participate), you can check how many hacks there are before yours at <a href="https://my.hackupc.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MyHackUPC</a>. The presentation can only be 3 minutes long and with no slides, Prezi's or any visual support except expect your hack. You can check out other projects at any judging room. The top teams will move on to an additional round of panel judging in the Closing Ceremony. If you participate in a challenge, you'll have to present at the specific sponsor room, which is independent of the HackUPC judging.
